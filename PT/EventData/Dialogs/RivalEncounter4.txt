Silver: Well look what the Meowth dragged in: $PlayerName$!
Silver: No surprise I'd see you here though;
Silver: Ya know I heard in Mahogany Town about a Team Rocket outpost in Goldenrod.
Silver: So I went there to crush those pathetic thugs only to find out that you already did!
Silver: That's how you know they were weak, losing to the likes of you..
Silver: But credit where it's due: good on ya for taking out those losers.
Silver: After that I went and got my 7th badge, and you know what that old guy Pryce told me?
Silver: That I don't love or trust my Pokemon enough and that's my weakness.
Silver: Hmph! Can you believe that? Me, having a weakness!
Silver: Let me prove how strong I am!
