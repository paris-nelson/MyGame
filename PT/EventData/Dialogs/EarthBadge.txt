Gym Leader Blue: ...
Gym Leader Blue: I-I can't believe it.
Gym Leader Blue: You've done it!
Gym Leader Blue: No wonder you reminded me of him...
Gym Leader Blue: You know, I haven't always been the leader of this gym.
Gym Leader Blue: There was another before me. 
Gym Leader Blue: He abandoned the gym after he was defeated.
Gym Leader Blue: I took his place and have been undefeated since.
Gym Leader Blue: The truth is, before that, there was a trainer who bested me.
Gym Leader Blue: One I could never beat; the same one who defeated my predecessor.
Gym Leader Blue: Red.
Gym Leader Blue: I've long since given up my obsessions with beating him
Gym Leader Blue: and have focused on being the best gym leader I can be.
Gym Leader Blue: As a result, no one's ever earned my badge until you.
Gym Leader Blue: Congratulations are absolutely in order for your achievement.
Gym Leader Blue: And if you ever decide you want to truly prove yourself the strongest trainer...
Gym Leader Blue: I know where you can find Red.
Gym Leader Blue: Before he disappeared, he mentioned the mythical Mt. Silver
Gym Leader Blue: That's where he went to train alone.
Gym Leader Blue: No one knows precisely where that is, but myth says it's somewhere in the Kanto Region...
Gym Leader Blue: It was a privilege battling you and your team; good luck on your journey!
Gym Leader Blue: Oh, I almost forgot!
Gym Leader Blue: I award you your eighth and final Kanto badge, the Earth Badge!
