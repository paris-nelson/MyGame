Gym Leader Pryce: It's no surprise that you bested Team Rocket with that team.

Gym Leader Pryce: I opened our doors to you as a favor for freeing our town of Team Rocket.
Gym Leader Pryce: But also as a test for a favor I must ask of you:
Gym Leader Pryce: The thugs you beat here were just an outpost of Team Rocket.
Gym Leader Pryce: Their current headquarters hideout is in Goldenrod City.
Gym Leader Pryce: Please go there and root them out for good!
Gym Leader Pryce: Thank you very much, $PlayerName$
