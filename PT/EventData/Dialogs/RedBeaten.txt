Red recalls his last Pokemon, and to your shocked surprise, he smiles.
Knowingly.
Red: Thank you, $PlayerName$!
Red: I told you I could already tell who was the better trainer between us.
Red: I knew it the second I saw the worn Rematcher peeking out of your bag.
Red: You see, I came here to train alone in hubris.
Red: I had beaten all the trainers there were to beat, acquired every badge,
Red: beaten the Elite Four, beaten Team Rocket, beaten Blue.
Red: I came here to train my Pokemon alone because I thought I had learned
Red: every lesson that anyone else could teach me.
Red: But I recently hit a limit; my Pokemon stopped getting stronger.
Red: The same with the joy I felt in training and battling.
Red: At first I thought I had simply reached the actual limit of Pokemon power.
Red: But I knew the truth; I had handicapped myself through my isolation.
Red: I knew that it was possible to become stronger than what I had achieved.
Red: And then you arrived; I could tell you were the better trainer.
Red: Clearly your Pokemon were powerful enough: you'd accomplished everything I had.
Red: But you understand the value of training with others.
Red: you don't see yourself as superior to those you've defeated;
Red: or others as stepping stones to your own greatness.
Red: I've suffered for my selfishness, as have my Pokemon.
Red: And with your arrival I realize, so did Blue.
Red: And any other trainer that I might have trained with in my lost time.
Red: We make each other better through battling and training together.
Red: In our battle I suspect my Pokemon and I gained more than in my entire time here.
Red: So this settles it, I'm leaving Mt. Silver.
Red: I'll go back home and go back to travelling and training with others.
Red: I encourage you to do the same.
Red: Find someone you can battle, train, and grow with. Improve off one another.
Red: And together, the Pokemon world will thrive! 
Red: Thank you again and see you around, $PlayerName$
