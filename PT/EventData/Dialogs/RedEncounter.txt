You approach the mysterious figure at the edge of the mountain ledge.
He turns and looks at you solemnly and curiously,
as someone who hadn't seen another person in a long time.
Red: ...
Red: How did you find me?
You mention Gym Leader Blue's story.
Red: Ah, my old rival Blue...
Red: You must be an outstanding trainer to have beaten Blue and acquired all 16 badges.
Red: Then you also know how to care for your Pokemon and enjoy training them.
Red: I presume then that you came here to defeat me;
Red: and in doing so, prove yourself the most powerful trainer.
Red: Then I must disappoint you.
Red: You see, I defeated the gym leaders long ago.
Red: There was no one worth challenging and no challenger worth accepting.
Red: Since then I've trained here alone since no one was my equal.
Red: I've reached the absolute pinnacle of my power.
Red: You came all the way here to prove something that cannot be proven.
Red: I will accept your challenge, though it is clear who is the better trainer among us.
