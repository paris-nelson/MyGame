Silver: Another fluke!
Silver: M-my Pokemon were weak from battling the Azalea gym leader.
Silver: You have 2 badges too?!
Silver: Yeah well see if you can keep up with me now that I'm really trying.
Silver: I won't let any weaklings hold me back, be it you or my Pokemon!
Silver: Speaking of which, I found this rare Pokemon and thought it would be strong.
Silver: But rare or not, it's just a weakling.
Silver: Seems like you two would get along fine; besides I have no use for weaklings.
Silver: Here, you take it.
Silver: Cya, $PlayerName$
