Silver: Why...Why do I lose?
Silver: I don't get it. I have tough Pokemon. I train them.
Silver: Is what that Pryce guy said true?
Silver: Trust..Love.. are they really holding me back?
Silver: I don't understand, but it's not gonna end here!
Silver: I'm still going to become the strongest Pokemon trainer!
