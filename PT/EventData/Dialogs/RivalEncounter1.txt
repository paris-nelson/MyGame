You're suddenly approached by someone you recognize.
It's Silver, who is your rival of sorts.
At least, he has it in his head that you're rivals.
You grew up together in New Bark Town and he always wants to beat you at everything.
Everything's always a competition with him.
Silver: Well if it isn't $PlayerName$...
Silver: I see you got a Pokemon, you a trainer now?
Silver: Looks like you chose the wrong starter though.
Silver: I got the one that has type advantage over yours!
Silver: You don't stand a chance against me, let me prove it!
